## 1. Overview

Buku Kerja Interaktif (Interactive Workbook) is a web-based, bilingual (Indonesian/English) learning platform designed for secondary school students. It combines structured English conversation lessons with gamified progress tracking via Duolingo integration.

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Traditional English workbooks lack interactivity, real-time progress tracking, and personalized feedback. Students struggle with motivation, and teachers have no centralized way to monitor individual performance across activities.

### 1.2 Solution

A single-page web application that delivers 8 learning units with interactive exercises, saves student data to Firebase in real-time, and provides teachers with a dashboard for manual grading and observation.
